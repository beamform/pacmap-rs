//! Manages weights used during the `PaCMAP` optimization process.
//!
//! The weights control how different types of point pairs influence the
//! embedding:
//! - Nearest neighbor pairs preserve local structure
//! - Mid-near pairs preserve medium-range structure
//! - Far pairs prevent collapse by maintaining separation
//!
//! The weights evolve through three phases during optimization:
//! 1. Gradually reduce mid-near weight to allow initial structure formation
//! 2. Balance local and global structure with equal mid-near and neighbor
//!    weights
//! 3. Focus on local structure by zeroing mid-near weight

/// Weight parameters applied to each type of point pair during optimization.

/// 2. Fix all weights to balance local and global structure (mid-near=3.0,
